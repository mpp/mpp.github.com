I'm master graduating in Informatics Engineering at the University of Padua in Italy (preview july 2013).\r\nI'm mainly interested in robotics, from building to program them. ([Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAzXULz65xU&feature=share&list=UUYn7PnwusUzHsQ05ntOaOgg) you can see a robot that I built some years ago in my spare time, maybe it can appear rude but at that time I had no experience on soldering or building frames.\r\n\r\nIn my github profile you can see some website projects, I worked till november 2012 in a media company ([www.aeranet.com](www.aeranet.com)) making for them lots of websites requested by their customers. This is not my favorite branch of computer science but it pays me university's fees.\r\n\r\nThe rest of projects that do not involve the web, are academic projects done in team with some classmates. Fell free to explore them.\r\n\r\nSee you soon.","tagline":"mpp"}
